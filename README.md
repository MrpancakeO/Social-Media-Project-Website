# Files
We have decided to break up the files using the best practices as taught in class, with HTML files being seperated from CSS & JS files. We have:
## HTML
- signup.html (For displaying the end-user signup page)
- signin.html (For displaying the end-user signin page)
- homepage.html (For displaying the end-user homepage)
- googleBookSearch.html (For displaying the google Book search api)

## CSS
- homepage.css (styling for homepage.html)
- styles.css (styling for signup.html)

## JS
- signup.js (script for running the signup screen)
- script.js (script for running the google search api, currently not in use)
- main.js (script for the validation function and google book search api)
- bookdisplay.js (for the main componets in the google book search api)

## Description of project
The goal for this project is to create a functional social media site that is easy to use and simplistic in design.

After the response from Assignment 1, we have decided to focus more of our efforts into getting the functionality and usability of our social media site, then clean up/modernize as we go on with the assignments.
## Workload/ How things Were Divided
Our development happened mostly during planned meetings/sessions, with both members (Brandon & Aman) working on the documents together, and at the end of the meeting dividing off the work for the other to devlopment before the next meeting. 

Brandon took lead with the html and implementation of the google search api, with Aman giving supoport when needed. Similarlly, Aman took lead with the functions and scripts, with Brandon giving support as well.

## Design Choices
We wanted to create a social media site similar to the sites we grew up with like Facebook and Twitter, before they were heavily revamped. the name BAS comes from the full name of the website, Brandon & Aman's Site. We felt the bas fish was a very fitting mascot for the website as well.
